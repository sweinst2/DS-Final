#I dont really know what im doing here but I am trying to clean up the data

#here I laid it out so that I can see all the genus and species data on thier own so I can begin to clean it up

#unique(OBA$Genus)
#unique(OBA$Species)

#here I am going to try to sort out a few bees based on genus idk if that will be super helpful but its what im going to do because i have to start somewhere 





#Goal here is to clean the species stuff up so that all the blank spots are gone
